# Awesome Tailwind Landing Page

Welcome to the Awesome Tailwind Landing Page project! This project is a simple landing page built using React and Tailwind CSS.
It's for practicing my skills with Tailwind and enhancing my React knowledge.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Please note that this landing page is a work in progress and is not fully responsive. I actively working on making it look fantastic on all devices.






# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
